5.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.2.1-1	X	X	X	CSPs will maintain all government data that is not physically located on DoD premises within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas of the US.	
5.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.2.1-2		X	X	To protect against seizure and improper use by non-US persons and government entities, all data / information stored and processed for the DoD must reside in a facility under the exclusive legal jurisdiction of the US.	
5.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.2.1-3	X	X	X	DoD CSPs will, and commercial CSPs may (under DoD contract), instantiate their cloud service architecture on DoD premises (DoD on-premises).	
5.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.2.1-4	X	X	X	Interconnection with DoD networks will be interoperable IAW engineering requirements that meet cybersecurity guidance and controls. DoD on-premises includes DoD data centers, other facilities located on a DoD B/C/P/S, or in a commercial or another government facility (or portions thereof) under the direct control of DoD personnel and DoD security policies.	
5.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.2.1-5	X	X	X	A CSP will provide the agency a list of the physical locations where the data could be stored at any given time and update that list as new physical locations are added.	
5.1	DoD-SRG-5.1-1	X	X	X	DoDI 8500.01 requires all DoD Information Systems to be categorized in accordance with CNSSI 1253 and implement a corresponding set of security controls and control enhancements (C/CEs) that are published in NIST SP 800-53, regardless of whether they are National Security Systems (NSS) or non-NSS.	
5.1.1	DoD-SRG-5.1.1-1	X	X	X	Impact Level 2 information may be hosted in a CSP that minimally holds a FedRAMP Moderate PA (with or without a DoD PA); subject to compliance with the personnel security requirements outlined in section 5.6.2 and acceptance by the Mission Owner and the responsible Authorizing Official (AO).	
5.1.1	DoD-SRG-5.1.1-2		X	X	The FedRAMP v2 Moderate baseline, supplemented with DoD FedRAMP+ C/CEs and requirements in this SRG, are used to assess CSPs toward awarding a DoD PA at information impact levels 4 and above.	
5.1.2	DoD-SRG-5.1.2-1			X	Since Impact Level 6 is for classified NSS, it is also subject to the CNSSI 1253 Classified Overlay which imposes ninety eight (98) additional controls/enhancements.	
5.1.2	DoD-SRG-5.1.2-2	X	X	X	Additionally, any level that deals with PII or PHI is additionally subject to the CNSSI 1253 Privacy Overlay	
5.2.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.2.2.1-1	X			The CSP must provide evidence of strong virtual separation controls and monitoring, and the ability to meet “search and seizure” requests without the release of DoD information and data.	
5.2.2.2	DoD-SRG-5.2.2.2-1		X		Information that must be processed and stored at Impact Level 5 can only be processed in a dedicated infrastructure, on-premises or off-premises in any cloud deployment model that restricts the physical location of the information as described in section 5.2.1, “Jurisdiction/Location Requirements.” This excludes public service offerings. The following applies: • Only DoD private, DoD community or Federal Government community clouds are eligible for Impact Level 5. • Each deployment model may support multiple missions or tenants / missions from each customer organization. • Virtual/logical separation between DoD and Federal Government tenants / missions is permitted. • Virtual/logical separation between tenant/mission systems is minimally required. • Physical separation (e.g. Dedicated Infrastructure) from non-DoD/non-Federal Government tenants is required. NOTE: A CSP may offer alternate solutions that provide equivalent security to the stated requirements. Approval will be assessed on a case by case basis during the PA assessment process.	
5.2.2.3	DoD-SRG-5.2.2.3-1			X	Impact Level 6 is reserved for the storage and processing of classified information. The following applies: • Impact Level 6 information up to the SECRET level must be stored and processed in a dedicated cloud infrastructure located in facilities approved for the processing of classified information, rated at or above the highest level of classification of the information being stored and/or processed. • On-premises locations are approved through DoD processes and are operated in accordance with DoD and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) policies. • Off-premises locations that restrict the physical location of the information as described in section 5.2.1, “Jurisdiction/Location Requirements” are approved in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) as defined in Executive Order 12829 and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)13, DoD 5220.22-M. • A Facility Security Clearance14 and cleared personnel are required. • The hosting organization must operate the facility in accordance with the NISPOM. Only DoD private, DoD community or Federal Government community clouds which are stand-alone or connected to SECRET networks (e.g., SIPRNet) are eligible for Impact Level 6. • Each deployment model may support multiple SECRET missions from each customer organization. • Virtual/logical separation between DoD and Federal Government tenants / SECRET missions is permitted. • Virtual/logical separation between tenant/mission systems is minimally required. • Physical separation (e.g. Dedicated Infrastructure) from non-DoD/non-Federal Government tenants is required.	
5.3	DoD-SRG-5.3-1	X	X	X	Both FedRAMP and DoD requires an ongoing assessment and authorization capability for CSPs providing services to the DoD. This capability is built upon the DoD RMF and the foundation of the FedRAMP continuous monitoring strategy, as described in the FedRAMP CONOPS and Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide. These ongoing assessment processes which are discussed in the following sections include continuous monitoring and change control.	
5.3.1	DoD-SRG-5.3.1-1	X	X	X	CSPs, 3PAOs, and DoD assessors are responsible for providing deliverables attesting to the implementation of security controls. Continuous monitoring data flows will differ for CSPs depending on whether they have a FedRAMP JAB PA, a 3PAO assessed Federal Agency ATO, or DoD Self-Assessed PA (as described in Section 4). These data flows are reflected in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 respectively. In some cases, CSPs will provide continuous monitoring artifacts directly to DISA. In such cases, the CSP will utilize commercial standard formats (e.g., comma-separated values, XML) that enable DoD to automate the ingest of continuous monitoring data. This section pertains specifically to continuous monitoring of security controls, as defined by CNSSI 4009 and NIST SP800-137. This is separate from monitoring activities performed as part of Computer Network Defense, which are described in Section 6.	
5.3.1.1	DoD-SRG-5.3.1.1-1	X	X	X	As described in section 4.1 Assessment of Commercial/Non-DoD Cloud Services, the CSPs, acceptable to DoD in the FedRAMP catalog include CSPs having a JAB PA (which is 3PAO assessed) or a 3PAO assessed Federal Agency ATO. These CSPs will provide all reports required by the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide, including self- assessments, to the FedRAMP Information System Security Officer (ISSO). These will be reviewed by the FedRAMP TRs and approved by the JAB if necessary. Continuous monitoring requirements for DoD are the same as those for FedRAMP, except that all reports and artifacts for FedRAMP+ C/CEs will be provided directly to DISA AO representatives as the DoD single point of CSP contact for this information. DISA will share all continuous monitoring information (FedRAMP and FedRAMP+) with appropriate Mission Owners, AOs, and Computer Network Defense (CND) Service Providers (CNDSPs). The information will be used by Mission Owners, their AOs, and the DISA AO to evaluate the risk posture of the CSP’s services. Those evaluations will inform decisions to continue the ATO for the Mission Owner’s system and the PA for the CSP respectively. The DISA AO will coordinate closely with Mission Owners in the event that the withdrawal of a PA must be considered upon the basis of this requirement. The information will be used by Mission Owners, their AOs, and the DISA AO to evaluate the risk posture of the CSP’s services. Those evaluations will inform decisions to continue the ATO for the Mission Owner’s system and the PA for the CSP respectively. The DISA AO will coordinate closely with Mission Owners in the event that the withdrawal of a PA must be considered upon the basis of this requirement.The information will be used by Mission Owners, their AOs, and the DISA AO to evaluate the risk posture of the CSP’s services. Those evaluations will inform decisions to continue the ATO for the Mission Owner’s system and the PA for the CSP respectively. The DISA AO will coordinate closely with Mission Owners in the event that the withdrawal of a PA must be considered upon the basis of this requirement.	
5.3.1.2	DoD-SRG-5.3.1.2-1	X	X	X	As part of the RMF authorization process, CSPs will create a continuous monitoring strategy that meets DoD requirements in the System Security Plan. All reports and artifacts required by that continuous monitoring strategy will be provided by the CSP to DISA. DISA will, in turn, disseminate those artifacts to all Mission Owners utilizing that CSO, the DISA AO, and the Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP) entities as defined in section 6, “Computer Network Defense and Incident Response.”	
5.3.2	DoD-SRG-5.3.2-1	X	X	X	The DoD will review all significant changes planned by a CSP. Like continuous monitoring, the change control process will differ for CSPs depending on if they are in the FedRAMP catalog and if they have a DoD assessed PA or AO. Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 show these change control processes.	
5.3.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.3.2.1-1	X	X	X	As part of the FedRAMP process, when the CSP holds a FedRAMP PA, the CSP will notify the FedRAMP ISSO of any planned significant change and subsequently provide a Security Impact Analysis for the planned change.	
5.3.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.3.2.1-2	X	X	X	When a CSP is included in the FedRAMP catalog, but does not have a JAB PA, the CSP will notify DISA directly, who will in turn notify the all Mission Owners utilizing that CSO, the DISA AO, and the CNDSP entities as defined in section 6, “Computer Network Defense and Incident Response.” For CSPs in the DoD Cloud Service Catalog, the Security Impact Analysis must additionally cover the FedRAMP+ C/CEs.	
5.4	DoD-SRG-5.4-1	X	X	X	In accordance with FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(12) which states “The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials” and the FedRAMP supplemental guidance which states “Include Common Access Card (CAC), i.e., the DoD technical implementation of PIV/FIPS 201/HSPD-12,” CSPs are required to integrate with and use the DoD PKI for DoD entity authentication.	
5.4	DoD-SRG-5.4-2	X			Whenever a CSP is responsible for authentication of entities and/or identifying a hosted DoD information system, the CSP will use DoD PKI in compliance with DoDI 8520.03. CSPs will enforce the use of a physical token referred to as the “Common Access Card (CAC)” or “Alt Token” for the authentication of privileged users. CSPs must make use of DoD Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Certificate Revocation List (CRL) resources for checking revocation of DoD certificates and DoD Certificate Authorities; and must follow DoD instructions and industry best practices for the management and protection of cryptographic keys.	
5.4	DoD-SRG-5.4-3	X	X		Whenever a CSP is responsible for authentication of entities and/or identifying a hosted DoD information system, the CSP will use DoD PKI in compliance with DoDI 8520.03. CSPs will enforce the use of a physical token referred to as the “Common Access Card (CAC)” or “Alt Token” for the authentication of privileged and non-privileged users. CSPs must make use of DoD OCSP or CRL resources for checking revocation of DoD certificates and DoD Certificate Authorities; and must follow DoD instructions and industry best practices for the management and protection of cryptographic keys. DoD issued PKI server certificates will be used to identify the CSP's DoD customer ordering/service management portals and SaaS applications and services contracted by and dedicated to DoD use.	
5.4	DoD-SRG-5.4-4			X	Whenever a CSP is responsible for authentication of DoD entities and/or identifying a hosted DoD information system, the CSP will use NSS PKI in compliance with DoDI 8520.03 and CNSSP-25. CSPs will enforce the use of a physical token referred to as the CNSS Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) Hardware Token for the authentication of Mission owner and CSP privileged and non-privileged end users. When implementing NSS PKI, CSPs must make use of NSS OCSP or CRL resources for checking revocation of NSS certificates and NSS Certificate Authorities; and must follow CNSS / NSA instructions for the management and protection of cryptographic keys. CNSS issued PKI server certificates will be used to identify the CSP's DoD customer ordering/service management portals and SaaS applications and services contracted by and dedicated to DoD use. NOTE: A CSP will need to PK enable their customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings and their SaaS service offerings for general DoD user access at levels 4 and up or provide a customer configurable service offering to permit PK enabling and integration with the required PKI. For complete compliance the CSP will integrate with the DoD PKI and the Federal PKI for levels 2 through 5. For Level 6 the CSP will integrate with the NSS (SIPRNet) PKI. Both the DoD and NSS PKI are operated by DISA15 while the Federal PKI is operated by GSA16. PK enable customer ordering/service management portals may require a separate URL or dedicated application / application interface as best determined by the CSP to meet the Federal Government requirement.	
5.4.1	DoD-SRG-5.4.1-1	X	X	X	DoDI 8520.03, Identity Authentication for Information Systems is the DoD policy that defines the credentials that DoD privileged and non-privileged users must use to identify themselves to DoD information systems to be authenticated before being granted access. It also defines the credentials that DoD information systems use to identify themselves to each other. This is fully applicable to DoD information systems instantiated on cloud services. Additionally, CNSS Policy #25 and CNSSI 1300 provide similar guidance for NSS. For the purpose of this discussion, the process of identification and authentication will be referred to as I&A.	
5.4.1.1	DoD-SRG-5.4.1.1-1	X			IAW DoD Policy: Non-privileged user access to publicly released information requires no I&A, unless the information owner requires it. If required, the Mission Owner determines the type of I&A to be used.  Non-privileged user access to non-publicly released non-CUI and non-critical mission information minimally requires I&A through the use of a User Identifier (UID) and password that meets DoD length and complexity requirements. The Mission Owner is encouraged to require the use of a stronger I&A technology in accordance with the sensitivity of the private information (e.g., two-factor token based onetime password, DoD ECA PKI certificate, CAC/PKI, etc.)  Privileged user’s access to administer Mission Owner systems/applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI. DoD External Certification Authority (ECA) PKI certificates may be used by DoD contractor personnel if a physical token cannot be provided. IAW FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(12): Mission Owner’s privileged user’s access to the CSP's customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI. DoD ECA PKI certificates may be used by DoD contractor personnel if a physical token cannot be provided.  Non-privileged user access to non-publicly released non-CUI and non-critical mission information in the CSP’s SaaS offering minimally requires I&A through the use of a User Identifier (UID) and password that meets DoD length and complexity requirements. The Mission Owner is encouraged to require the use of a stronger I&A technology in accordance with the sensitivity of the private information (e.g., two-factor token based onetime password, DoD ECA PKI certificate, CAC/PKI, etc.)	
5.4.1.1	DoD-SRG-5.4.1.1-2	X	X		IAW DoD Policy: Non-privileged user access to CUI, non-CUI critical mission data, and/or unclassified NSS (L5) requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI. DoD ECA PKI certificates may be used by DoD contractor personnel if a physical token cannot be provided.  Privileged user’s access to administer Mission Owner systems/applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI. DoD ECA PKI certificates may be used by DoD contractor personnel if a physical token cannot be provided. IAW FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(12): Non-privileged user access to CUI, non-CUI critical mission data, and/or unclassified NSS (L5) information in the CSP’s SaaS offering requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI. DoD ECA PKI certificates may be used by DoD contractor personnel if a physical token cannot be provided.  Mission Owner’s privileged user’s access to the CSP's customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI. DoD ECA PKI certificates may be used by DoD contractor personnel if a physical token cannot be provided.	
5.4.1.1	DoD-SRG-5.4.1.1-3			X	IAW DoD Policy: Non-privileged user access to classified information requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI.  Privileged user’s access to administer Mission Owner systems/applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI IAW FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(12): Non-privileged user access to classified information in the CSP’s SaaS offering requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI.  Mission Owner’s privileged users access to the CSP's customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI.	
5.4.1.2	DoD-SRG-5.4.1.2-1	X			IAW FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(1) and IA-2(3), the CSP must minimally implement two factor authentication for CSP privileged user access to administer and maintain CSP infrastructure supporting Federal and DoD contracted services.	
5.4.1.2	DoD-SRG-5.4.1.2-2		X		IAW DoD policy, the CSP must implement a dedicated strong two-factor I&A capability for CSP privileged user access to administer and maintain dedicated CSP infrastructure supporting DoD contracted services.	
5.4.1.2	DoD-SRG-5.4.1.2-3			X	IAW CNSS policy, the CSP must implement SIPRNet Token/PKI authentication for CSP privileged user access to administer and maintain dedicated CSP infrastructure supporting Federal and DoD contracted services.	
5.5	DoD-SRG-5.5-1	X	X	X	DoD-specific policy, guidance and operational constraints must be followed as appropriate by CSPs. DISA will evaluate CSP submitted equivalencies to any specific security control, SRG, or STIG requirement on a case by case basis.	
5.5.1	DoD-SRG-5.5.1-1	X	X	X	STIGs are applicable if the CSP utilizes the product the STIG addresses. SRGs are applicable in lieu of STIGs if a product specific STIG is not available. However, the SP 800-53 control applies whether or not a STIG or SRG is available. CSPs must utilize all applicable DoD STIGs and/or SRGs to secure all DoD contracted cloud computing services provided on dedicated infrastructure that only serves DoD tenants. This applies at levels 4 and above for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings.	
5.6.1	DoD-SRG-5.6.1-1	X	X		CSP data processing facilities supporting Level 4 and 5 information will meet the physical security requirements defined in the FedRAMP Moderate baseline as well as any FedRAMP+ C/CEs related to physical security.	
5.6.1	DoD-SRG-5.6.1-2			X	DoD data processing facilities that support cloud services infrastructure and classified service offerings will be housed in facilities (designated as a secure room) designed, built, and approved for open storage commensurate with the highest classification level of the information stored, processed, or transmitted as defined in DoDM 5200.01 Volume 3. DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information. Commercial CSP’s data processing facilities that support cloud services infrastructure and classified service offerings must participate in and be approved through the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) to receive a facilities clearance19. The requirements for NISP are outlined in DoD 5220.22M – the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)20. To receive a DoD PA for Level 6, a CSP must either have a facility clearance or be verified that they can meet the requirements to receive it when a contract is executed.	
5.6.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.6.2.1-1	X	X	X	From a DoD policy perspective under PS-2 and IAW DoD 5200.2-R, Category I automated data processing (ADP) (ADP-1 or IT-1), positions include those in which an individual is responsible for the planning, direction, and implementation of a computer security program; has major responsibility for the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or can access a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way and with a relatively high risk for causing grave damage or realize a significant personal gain. These positions are designated “critical-sensitive”.	
5.6.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.6.2.1-2	X	X	X	Category II automated data processing (ADP) (ADP-2 or IT-2) positions include those in which an individual may have the same responsibilities listed for ADP-1 but whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority of the ADP-I category to insure the integrity of the system. These positions are designated “noncritical-sensitive”. These designations are in consistent with the OPM Position Designation System October 2010 document21 and automated tool22.	
5.6.2.1	DoD-SRG-5.6.2.1-3	X	X	X	To receive a DoD PA, the CSP must demonstrate that their personnel position categorization and compliance with PS-2 is equivalent to the OPM position designations for the similar CSP positions to the “critical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-1) or “high risk”; “noncritical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-2) or “moderate risk”; and/or “non-sensitive” or “low risk” (i.e., access to only non-CUI and public information) position designations. These designations drive the level of screening to be established IAW the second half of PS-2 and for PS-3.	
5.6.2.2	DoD-SRG-5.6.2.2-1	X	X		CSP personnel supporting Level 4 and 5 cloud service offerings will meet the personnel security requirements and undergo background checks as defined in OPM policy IAW the FedRAMP Moderate baseline, the FedRAMP+ CEs related to personnel security, and DoD personnel security policies. As such the minimum background investigation required for CSP personnel having access to Level 4 and 5 information based on a “critical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-1) position designation, is a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or a Background Investigation (BI) for a “high risk” position designation. The minimum background investigation required for CSP personnel having access to Level 4 and 5 information based on a “noncritical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-2) is a National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) (for “noncritical-sensitive” contractors), or a Moderate Risk Background Investigation (MBI) for a “moderate risk” position designation. NOTE: To receive a DoD PA for Level 2, 4, or 5, the CSP must comply with the investigation requirements as listed for personnel requiring access to systems and data (e.g. above the hypervisor). Personnel who have access to the CSP infrastructure (e.g. at the hypervisor or below) must comply with OPM investigation requirements or the CSP must demonstrate that their personnel background investigations and compliance with PS-3 and PS-3(3) are consistent with OPM investigation requirements for each position designation.	
5.6.2.2	DoD-SRG-5.6.2.2-2			X	In accordance with PS-3(1), invoked by the CNSSI 1253 Classified Information Overlay, personnel having access to a secure room, the infrastructure supporting classified processing, or handling classified information, in addition to meeting the public trust position suitability/investigation requirements (e.g., a favorably adjudicated SSBI for a system administrator in a DoD ADP-1 position) must have a security clearance at the appropriate level. Systems and network administrators (i.e., privileged users), while typically not approved to handle classified information for need-to-know reasons, are considered to have access to classified information through their duties. Therefore these individuals require a clearance at the appropriate level for the classified information stored, processed, or transmitted DoD personnel clearances are granted through DoD processes as defined in DoDI 5200.02 and the DoD 5200.2-R, both entitled DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP). Commercial CSPs’ personnel clearances are granted through the Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Process24. To receive a DoD PA for Level 6, the CSP must either have a facility clearance and cleared personnel who will manage the CSO, or demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements for such as defined in Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Process.	
5.7	DoD-SRG-5.7-1	X	X	X	Variability in CSP infrastructures precludes the possibility of establishing a single cleanup process. Instead, CSPs will be responsible for providing methods and timelines for deleting specified units of data within their infrastructure in a way that provides high assurance that such data cannot be reconstructed. An example of such a process is: • Volatile hardware with subject data will be powered down within 24 hours to clear data, subject to exceptions based on potential side effects of cleanup actions. • Unencrypted subject data locations on nonvolatile storage hardware will be overwritten or “cleared” as defined in NIST 800-88 within 24 hours, subject to exceptions based on potential side effects of cleanup actions. Encrypted subject data will be deleted cryptographically by destroying the appropriate decryption keys, then “cleared” and overwritten. • Affected nonvolatile storage hardware will be tracked through required inventory processes and destroyed at the end of its useful life.	
5.8	DoD-SRG-5.8-1	X	X	X	Upon request by a Mission Owner, the CSP will make all Mission Owner data stored in certain service offerings available for electronic transfer out of the CSP environment, with subsequent destruction, within 60 days from the date of request. This primarily applies to any service offerings where the Mission Owner cannot just download files and request destruction of the files, as might be the case if the Mission Owner’s data is co-mingled in a large database with other Mission Owner’s data. Each Mission Owner may also request different means of data transfer (for example, as called out in the SLA), at its discretion.	
5.8	DoD-SRG-5.8-2	X	X	X	The subsequent destruction of transferred Mission Owner data must include removal from all CSO backups or mirrored storage maintained by the CSP. This is to prevent the Mission Owner data from being restored accidentally or intentionally after destruction has concluded.	
5.8	DoD-SRG-5.8-3	X	X	X	To support removal/recovery/destruction of CSP customer data in this type of service offering, the CSP must be able to identify Mission Owner data on a mission by mission basis. The CSP will provide assurance of all data destruction.	
5.9	DoD-SRG-5.9-1	X	X		CSPs may not reuse or dispose of storage hardware until all DoD data has been successfully removed. The CSP will minimally ensure this by “Purging” all data on devices prior to decommissioning, disposal, reuse, or transfer, in accordance with NIST 800-88.

Access to this form requires a DoD-approved medium assurance External Certificate Authority (ECA) certificate. If you are unable to access this form, please call (877) 838-2174 or email: DCISE@DC3.mil. The CSP must include, for routing purposes, all MCND points of contact (POCs) for all DoD missions affected by the incident. This is in addition to any other POCs required by the tool for routing to contract managers, etc. The MCND, once the report is received, will initiate the DoD reporting process via JIMS. Note: The Incident Collection Form (ICF) requires modification in order to be fully aligned with the above reporting requirements. In the interim the current form will be used. CSPs should complete the fields as appropriate. When classified incident reporting is appropriate and directed, CSPs will use SIPRNet email or secure phone/fax to report and coordinate incidents as specified. This will always be the case for Level 6 reporting. Existing notification mechanisms of a CSP that are already in place to communicate between the CSP and its customers for some or all classes of CND information may be used, as long as those mechanisms demonstrate a level of assurance, equivalent to the listed encrypted mechanisms, for the confidentiality and integrity of the information.
