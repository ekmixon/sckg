rationale: 'Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability

  and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case,

  the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The

  default setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which

  might be to high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources

  and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage

  collection.'
