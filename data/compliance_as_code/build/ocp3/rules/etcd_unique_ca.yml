description: 'A unique and different CA certificate should be created for <tt>etcd</tt>.

  To ensure the <tt>etcd</tt> service is using a unique certificate,

  , set <tt>ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE</tt> to <tt>/etc/etcd/ca.crt</tt>

  in <tt>/etc/etcd/etcd.conf</tt> on the master node that does NOT match

  the OpenShift CA certificate:

identifiers: {cce: 80585-3}
ocil: 'Run the following command on the master node(s):

  <pre>$ grep ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE /etc/etcd/etcd.conf</pre>

  Inspect the certificate file that is returned and verify that it

  does not match the OpenShift CA certificate.'
ocil_clause: the etcd CA certificate is not unique
oval_external_content: null
platform: null
prodtype: ocp3
rationale: 'A unique CA certificate that is utilized by etcd and is different from

  OpenShift ensures that the etcd data is still protected in the event that

  the OpenShift certificate is compromised.'
