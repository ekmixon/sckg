description: 'By default, traffic for the OpenShift API server is served over

  HTTPS with authentication and authorization, and the secure API endpoint

  is bound to 0.0.0.0:8443. To ensure that the insecure port configuration

  has not been enabled, the <tt>insecure-port</tt> setting should not exist

  in <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s).'

rationale: 'Configuring the API Server on an insecure port would allow unauthenticated

  and unencrypted access to your master node(s). It is assumed firewall rules

  will be configured to ensure this port is not reachable from outside

  the cluster, however as a defense in depth measure, OpenShift should not

  be configured to use insecure ports.'
