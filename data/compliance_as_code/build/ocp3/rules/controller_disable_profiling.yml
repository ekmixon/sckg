description: 'Profiling endpoints are exposed at each master port and secured via
  Role-Based

  Access Control (RBAC). By default profiling is accessible only to users bound to

  <tt>cluster-admin</tt> or <tt>cluster-debugger</tt> roles, limiting access to authorized

  users only.


  Should <tt>OPENSHIFT_PROFILE</tt> be set to <tt>web</tt>, reflecting a change from

  the secure defaults, this profiling data will be exposed via a web interface on
  the

  systems localhost interface.


  To ensure profiling data is not exposed over a web interface, ensure

  <tt>OPENSHIFT_PROFILE</tt> is not set to <tt>web</tt> in <tt>/etc/origin/master/master.env</tt>.'
