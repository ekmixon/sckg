rationale: 'Setting global request timout allows extending the API Server request

  timeout limit to a duration appropriate to the user''s connection speed.

  By default, it is set to 60 seconds which might be problematic on

  slower connections making cluster resources inaccessible once the data

  volume for requests exceeds what can be transmitted in 60 seconds. But,

  setting this timeout limit to be too large can exhaust the API Server

  resources making it prone to Denial-of-Service attack. It is recommended

  to set this limit as appropriate and change the default limit of 60

  seconds only if needed.'
