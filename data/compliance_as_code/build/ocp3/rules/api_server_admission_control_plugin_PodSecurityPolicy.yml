rationale: 'A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls the actions

  which a pod can perform and what the pod may access. The

  <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt> objects define a set of conditions that a pod

  must run with in order to be accepted into the system. Pod Security Policies

  are comprised of settings and strategies that control the security features

  a pod has access to and hence this must be used to control pod access

  permissions.'
