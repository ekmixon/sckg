rationale: 'Setting admission control policy to include <tt>AlwaysPullImages</tt>
  forces

  every new pod to pull the required images during every build. In a multi-tenant

  cluster users can be assured that private images can only be used by those who

  have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once

  an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by

  knowing the image''s name (without any authorization check against the image

  access control lists). When this plugin is enabled, images are always pulled

  prior to starting containers and forces authorization.'
