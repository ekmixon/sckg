rationale: 'CNI (Container Network Interface) files consist of a specification and
  libraries for

  writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers, along with
  a number

  of supported plugins. Allowing writeable access to the files could allow an attacker
  to modify

  the networking configuration potentially adding a rouge network connection.'
