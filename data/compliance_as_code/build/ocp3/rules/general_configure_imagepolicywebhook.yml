description: 'OpenShift administrators can control which images can be imported, tagged,
  and run in a cluster.

  There are two facilities for this purpose: (1) Allowed Registries, allowing administrators
  to

  restrict image origins to known external registries; and (2) ImagePolicy Admission
  plug-in which lets

  administrators specify specific images which are allowed to run on the OpenShift
  cluster.


  Configure Image Provenance using the <tt>ImagePolicyWebhook</tt> admission controller
  per

  the Image Policy chapter in the Cluster Administration documentation:


  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/image_policy.html'
