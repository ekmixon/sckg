description: 'Security Context Constraints (SCC) control what actions pods can perform
  and what resources

  they can access. SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy
  object

  that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not
  limited to,

  Linux Capabilities, Seccomp profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts.


  OpenShift ships with several SCCs. The most constrained is the <tt>restricted</tt>
  SCC, and the

  least constrained is the <tt>privileged</tt> SCC. The others provide intermediate
  levels of

  constraint for various use cases. The <tt>restricted</tt> SCC is granted to all
  authenticated

  users by default.


  If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different
  SCCs. As

  a general principal pods should always be ran with the most restrictive SCC possible.


  Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod. With the default
  project

  template, new projects receive a Service Account named <tt>default</tt> that is
  used to run pods. This

  default service account is only granted the ability to run the <tt>restricted</tt>
  SCC.'
