rationale: '<tt>AdvancedAuditing</tt> enables a much more general API auditing

  pipeline, which includes support for pluggable output backends and an

  audit policy specifying how different requests should be audited.

  Additionally, this enables auditing of failed authentication,

  authorization, and login attempts which could prove crucial for

  protecting your production clusters. It is recommended not to disable

  advanced auditing.'
