rationale: 'Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance

  bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could

  potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are

  not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for

  troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the

  potential attack surface.'
