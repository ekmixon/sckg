rationale: 'Using <tt>EventRateLimit</tt> admission control enforces a limit on the

  number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice.

  In a large multi-tenant cluster, there might be a small percentage of

  misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the

  performance of the cluster overall. It is recommended to limit the rate

  of events that the API Server will accept.'
