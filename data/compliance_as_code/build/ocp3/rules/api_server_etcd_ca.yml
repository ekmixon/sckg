rationale: 'etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by OpenShift deployments

  for persistent storage of all REST API objects. These objects are

  sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This

  requires the API Server to identify itself to the etcd server using

  a SSL Certificate Authority file.'
