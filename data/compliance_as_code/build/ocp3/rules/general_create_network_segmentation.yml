description: 'OpenShuft provides multi-tenant network isolation to segregate network
  traffic between

  containers belonging to different tenants (users or applications) while running
  on a shared

  cluster. Red Hat also works with 3rd-party SDN vendors to provide the same level
  of capabilities

  integrated with OpenShift. For stronger security, create network segmentation using
  Network Policies

  as it provides finer-grained control.'
