  <title>Guide to the Secure Configuration of JBoss EAP 6</title>
  <description>This guide presents a catalog of security-relevant
configuration settings for JBoss EAP 6. It is a rendering of
content structured in the eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)
in order to support security automation.  The SCAP content is
is available in the <tt>scap-security-guide</tt> package which is developed at

    <html:a href="https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide">https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide</html:a>.
<br/><br/>
Providing system administrators with such guidance informs them how to securely
configure systems under their control in a variety of network roles. Policy
makers and baseline creators can use this catalog of settings, with its
associated references to higher-level security control catalogs, in order to
assist them in security baseline creation. This guide is a <em>catalog, not a
checklist</em>, and satisfaction of every item is not likely to be possible or
sensible in many operational scenarios. However, the XCCDF format enables
granular selection and adjustment of settings, and their association with OVAL
and OCIL content provides an automated checking capability. Transformations of
this document, and its associated automated checking content, are capable of
providing baselines that meet a diverse set of policy objectives. Some example
XCCDF <em>Profiles</em>, which are selections of items that form checklists and
can be used as baselines, are available with this guide. They can be
processed, in an automated fashion, with tools that support the Security
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). The DISA STIG for JBoss EAP 6,
which provides required settings for US Department of Defense systems, is
one example of a baseline created from this guidance.

this guide without first testing them in a non-operational environment. The

users' accounts are used for the management of the server and the applications

      <description>Configure the application server to authenticate privileged users via
multifactor/certificate-based authentication mechanisms when using network
access to the management interface.</description>
      <rationale>Multifactor authentication creates a layered defense and makes it more
difficult for an unauthorized person to access the application server. If one
factor is compromised or broken, the attacker still has at least one more
barrier to breach before successfully breaking into the target. Unlike a simple
username/password scenario where the attacker could gain access by knowing both
the username and password without the user knowing his account was compromised,
multifactor authentication adds the requirement that the attacker must have
something from the user, such as a token, or to biometrically be the user.
Multifactor authentication is defined as: using two or more factors to achieve
authentication.
<br/><br/>
Factors include:
(i) something a user knows (e.g.,
password/PIN);
(ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification
device, token); or
(iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric). A CAC or PKI
Hardware Token meets this definition.
<br/><br/>
A privileged account is defined as an
information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. These
accounts would be capable of accessing the web management interface.
<br/><br/>
When
accessing the application server via a network connection, administrative access
to the application server must be PKI Hardware Token enabled or a DoD-approved
soft certificate.</rationale>
