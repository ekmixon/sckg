description: Obtain vendor support from Red Hat.

ocil: 'Interview the system admin and have them either show documented proof of

  current support, or have them demonstrate their ability to access the Red Hat

  Enterprise Support portal.

  <br /><br />

  Verify Red Hat support includes coverage for the

  JBoss product.

  <br /><br />

  If there is no current and active support from the vendor, this

  is a finding.'

rationale: 'The JBoss product is available as Open Source; however, the Red Hat vendor

  provides updates, patches and support for the JBoss product. It is imperative

  that patches and updates be applied to JBoss in a timely manner as many attacks

  against JBoss focus on unpatched systems. It is critical that support be

  obtained and made available.'
