rationale: 'When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, it
  should

  be noted that any changes to the software and/or application server

  configuration can potentially have significant effects on the overall security

  of the system.

  <br /><br />

  Access restrictions for changes also include application

  software libraries.

  <br /><br />

  If the application server provides automatic code

  deployment capability, (where updates to applications hosted on the application

  server are automatically performed, usually by the developers'' IDE tool), it

  must also provide a capability to restrict the use of automatic application

  deployment. Automatic code deployments are allowable in a development

  environment, but not in production.'
