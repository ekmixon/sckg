rationale: 'Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they
  may be

  issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DoD systems or by

  organizations with insufficient security controls. If the CA used for verifying

  the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been

  established.

  <br /><br />

  The DoD will only accept PKI certificates obtained from a DoD-

  approved internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the

  establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of SSL/TLS

  certificates. The application server must only allow the use of DoD PKI-

  established certificate authorities for verification.'
