description: 'Configure the application server to off-load log records every seven
  days onto

  a different system or media from the system being logged.'
identifiers: {cce: 80463-3}
ocil: 'Interview the system admin and obtain details on how the log files are being

  off-loaded to a different system or media.

  <br /><br />

  If the log files are not off-loaded

  a minimum of every 7 days, this is a finding.'

rationale: 'JBoss logs by default are written to the local file system. A centralized

  logging solution like syslog should be used whenever possible; however, any log

  data stored to the file system needs to be off-loaded. JBoss EAP does not

  provide an automated backup capability. Instead, reliance is placed on OS or

  third-party tools to back up or off-load the log files.

  <br /><br />

  Protection of log data

  includes assuring log data is not accidentally lost or deleted. Off-loading log

  records to a different system or onto separate media from the system the

  application server is actually running on helps to assure that, in the event of

  a catastrophic system failure, the log records will be retained.'
