description: 'Configure the application server to use DoD- or CNSS-approved Class
  3 or Class

  4 PKI certificates.'
identifiers: {cce: 80497-1}
ocil: 'Interview the administrator to determine if JBoss is using certificates for

  PKI. If JBoss is not performing any PKI functions, this finding is NA.

  <br /><br />

  The CA

  certs are usually stored in a file called cacerts located in the directory

  <tt>$JAVA_HOME/lib/security</tt>. If the file is not in this location, use a search

  command to locate the file, or ask the administrator where the certificate store

  is located.

  <br /><br />

  Open a dos shell or terminal window and change to the location of

  the certificate store. To view the certificates within the certificate store,

  run the command (in this example, the keystore file is cacerts.):

  <pre>keytool -list -v -keystore ./cacerts</pre>

  <br /><br />

  Locate the <pre>OU</pre> field for each certificate

  within the keystore. The field should contain either <pre>DoD</pre> or

  <pre>CNSS</pre> as the Organizational Unit (OU).

  <br /><br />

  If the OU does not show that

  the certificates are DoD or CNSS supplied, this is a finding.'

rationale: 'Class 3 PKI certificates are used for servers and software signing rather
  than

  for identifying individuals. Class 4 certificates are used for business-to-

  business transactions. Utilizing unapproved certificates not issued or approved

  by DoD or CNS creates an integrity risk. The application server must utilize

  approved DoD or CNS Class 3 or Class 4 certificates for software signing and

  business-to-business transactions.'
