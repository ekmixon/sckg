description: 'While JBoss itself has no need to load FIPS compliant modules,

  the underlying technologies such as Java do. Utilizing only FIPS compliant

  modules decreases compatibility with applications that are not FIPS enabled.'

rationale: 'Enabling FIPS compliant algorithms ensures that the underlying technologies

  that JBoss works through are using cryptographic modules that have been

  vetted by NIST for security, stability, and strength. Failure to utilize

  FIPS certified modules may cause the underlying technologies used by JBoss to

  utilize older, less secure algorithms. Failure to enable only FIPS compliant

  modules may also have regulatory consequences, as FIPS 140-2 requires the

  use of FIPS compliant modules by all federal agencies.'
