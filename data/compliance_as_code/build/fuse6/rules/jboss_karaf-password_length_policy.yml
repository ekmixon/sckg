rationale: 'In brute force scenarios, passwords of extended lengths increase

  password security and the length of time required to decrypt the password.

  However, there are risks associated with requiring passwords of great

  lengths, as users may take steps to circumvent policy; such as using

  repetitive passwords, writing password reminders, or writing down their

  passwords.'
