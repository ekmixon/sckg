  These permissions are enforced by the Java Security Manager and the policies

  it loads at startup. These permissions can be assigned or restricted in an

rationale: 'Java permissions for deployed applications should be carefully restricted

  to enforce the least privilege principle. Granting RuntimePermission to

  applications allows these applications to modify classloaders or modify

  the running security manager. Either of these actions can be used to

  elevate permissions and increase the number of potential damaging actions

  that can be taken.'
