rationale: "Encryption is only as good as the encryption modules utilized. Unapproved\n\
  cryptographic module algorithms cannot be verified, and cannot be relied\nupon to\
  \ provide confidentiality or integrity and DoD data may be\ncompromised due to weak\
  \ algorithms.\_FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for\nvalidating cryptographic\
  \ modules and NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4)\nproducts are NSA certified hardware-based\
  \ encryption modules."
