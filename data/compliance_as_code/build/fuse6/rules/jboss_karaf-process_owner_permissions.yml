rationale: 'In order to reduce the potential impact of exploitation against the JBoss

  application server (and the rest of the operating environment), the JBoss process

  owner should execute with as few permissions as possible in the environment

  (if the account is not local to the operating system or is distributed across

  multiple operating systems). Failure to limit permissions can dramatically

  increase the severity of exploits against the JBoss server, such as the

  execution of arbitrary code.'
