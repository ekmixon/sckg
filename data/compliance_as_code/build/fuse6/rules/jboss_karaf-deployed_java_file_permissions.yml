description: 'Deployed applications must not be granted file permissions

  - except to those that are dedicated to the application only. These

  permissions are enforced by the Java Security Manager and the policies it

  loads at startup. These permissions can be assigned or restricted in an

  application-specific, granular manner.'

rationale: 'Java permissions for deployed applications should be carefully restricted

  to enforce the least privilege principle. Granting unrestricted access to

  the host operating system creates a large attack vector for malicious
