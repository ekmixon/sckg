description: 'The account lockout feature limits the number of incorrect password

  attempts. If a user fails to authenticate after the maximum number

  of attempts, the service disables the user.

  <br />

  The maximum number of failed authentication attempts is set by the

  <tt>lockout_failure_attempts</tt> option in under the

  <tt>[security_compliance]</tt> section in <tt>keystone.conf</tt>.'
