rationale: 'Google Sync is used to sync information between different user devices,

  this data is then stored on Google owned servers. The synced data may consist

  of information such as email, calendars, viewing history, etc. This feature must

  be disabled because the organization does not have control over the servers the

  data is stored on.'
