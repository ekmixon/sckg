rationale: "Website tracking is the practice of gathering information as to which\
  \ websites\nwere accesses by a browser. The common method of doing this is to have\
  \ a website\ncreate a tracking cookie on the browser. If the information of what\
  \ sites are\nbeing accessed is made available to unauthorized persons, this violates\
  \ \nconfidentiality requirements, and over time poses a significant OPSEC issue."
