ocil: 'To verify that all plugins are blacklisted, run the following command:

  <pre>$ grep DisabledPlugins /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>

  The output should contain:

rationale: 'Plugins can access almost anything on a system and users can enable or
  install them

  at will. This means they pose a high risk to any system that would allow all plugins

  to be installed by default.'
