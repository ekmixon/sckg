description: 'Each access to a URL is handled by the browser according to the URL''s
  "scheme".

  The "scheme" of a URL is the section before the ":". The term "protocol" is often

  mistakenly used for a "scheme". The difference is that the scheme is how the browser

  handles a URL and the protocol is how the browser communicates with a service. To

  disable insecure and obsolete protocol schema, set <tt>URLBlacklist</tt> to

  <tt><sub idref="var_url_blacklist" /></tt> in the Chromium policy file.'
identifiers: {}
ocil: 'To verify that data synchronization is disabled, run the following command:

  <pre>$ grep URLBlacklist /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>

  The output should contain:

  <pre>"URLBlacklist": ["<sub idref="var_url_blacklist" />"],</pre>'

rationale: 'If a scheme or its associated protocol used by a browser is insecure or
  obsolete,

  vulnerabilities can be exploited resulting in exposed data or unrestricted access

  to the browser''s system.'
