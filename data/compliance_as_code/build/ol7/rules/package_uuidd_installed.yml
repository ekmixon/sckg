description: 'The package <tt>uuidd</tt> is not installed on normal Linux distribution

  by default. Applications require this package to avoid database

  inconsistences caused by duplicated UUIDs. Especially in banking services

  with SAP where massive UUIDs are created in a short time period, it is

  important to install the package <tt>uuidd</tt>. More information can be

  found in SAP note 1391070.

  The <code>uuidd</code> package can be installed with the following command:

  <pre>

  $ sudo yum install uuidd</pre>'
