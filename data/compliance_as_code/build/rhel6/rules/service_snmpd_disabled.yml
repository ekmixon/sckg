description: ' The <code>snmpd</code> service can be disabled with the following command:
  <pre>$ sudo chkconfig snmpd off</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 26906-8}
ocil: ' To check that the <code>snmpd</code> service is disabled in system boot configuration,
  run the following command: <pre>$ sudo chkconfig <code>snmpd</code> --list</pre>
  Output should indicate the <code>snmpd</code> service has either not been installed,
  or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below: <pre>$ sudo
  chkconfig <code>snmpd</code> --list <code>snmpd</code>       0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off</pre>

  Run the following command to verify <code>snmpd</code> is disabled through current
  runtime configuration: <pre>$ sudo service snmpd status</pre>

  If the service is disabled the command will return the following output: <pre>snmpd
  is stopped</pre>'
