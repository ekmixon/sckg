description: 'The rpcsvcgssd service manages RPCSEC GSS contexts required to

  secure protocols that use RPC (most often Kerberos and NFS). The rpcsvcgssd

  service is the server-side of RPCSEC GSS. If the system does not require secure

  RPC then this service should be disabled.


  The <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo chkconfig rpcsvcgssd off</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 27122-1}
ocil: ' To check that the <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> service is disabled in system boot
  configuration, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo chkconfig <code>rpcsvcgssd</code>
  --list</pre> Output should indicate the <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> service has either
  not been installed, or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example
  below: <pre>$ sudo chkconfig <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> --list <code>rpcsvcgssd</code>       0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off</pre>

  Run the following command to verify <code>rpcsvcgssd</code> is disabled through
  current runtime configuration: <pre>$ sudo service rpcsvcgssd status</pre>

  If the service is disabled the command will return the following output: <pre>rpcsvcgssd
  is stopped</pre>'
