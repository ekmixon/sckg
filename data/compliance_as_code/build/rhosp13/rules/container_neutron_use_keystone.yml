description: "OpenStack supports various authentication strategies like noauth, keystone\
  \ etc.\nIf the \u2018noauth\u2019 strategy is used then the users could interact\
  \ with OpenStack services\nwithout any authentication. This could be a potential\
  \ risk since an attacker might gain\nunauthorized access to the OpenStack components.\
  \ Thus it is strongly recommended that\nall services must be authenticated with\
  \ keystone using their service accounts.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nPass: If value of parameter\
  \ auth_strategy under [DEFAULT] section in\n/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/neutron/etc/neutron/neutron.conf\
  \ is set to keystone.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nFail: If value of parameter auth_strategy\
  \ under [DEFAULT] section is set to noauth or noauth2."
