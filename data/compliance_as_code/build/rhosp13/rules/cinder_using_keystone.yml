description: "OpenStack supports various authentication strategies like noauth, keystone\
  \ etc. If the \u2018noauth\u2019 strategy is used then the users could interact\
  \ with OpenStack services without any authentication. This could be a potential\
  \ risk since an attacker might gain unauthorized access to the OpenStack components.\
  \ Thus it is strongly recommended that all services must be authenticated with keystone\
  \ using their service accounts.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nPass: If value of parameter auth_strategy\
  \ under [DEFAULT] section in /etc/cinder/cinder.conf is set to keystone.\n\n<br\
  \ />\n<br />\nFail: If value of parameter auth_strategy under [DEFAULT] section\
  \ is set to noauth."
