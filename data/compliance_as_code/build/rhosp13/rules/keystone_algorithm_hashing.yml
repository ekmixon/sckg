description: 'MD5 is a weak and depreciated hashing algorithm. It can be cracked using
  brute force attack. Identity tokens are sensitive and need to be protected with
  a stronger hashing algorithm to prevent unauthorized disclosure and subsequent access.

  <br />

  Pass: If value of parameter hash_algorithm under [token] section in /etc/keystone/keystone.conf
  is set to SHA256.
