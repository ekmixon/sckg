  run the following command:

rationale: 'Allowing software updates from non-trusted sites can introduce settings

  that will override a secured installation of the application. This can

  place DoD information at risk. If this setting is enabled, then there are

  many other default settings which point to untrusted sites which must be

  changed to point to an authorized update site that is not publicly accessible.'
