description: 'The Shared System Certificates store makes NSS, GnuTLS, OpenSSL, and
  Java

  share a default source for retrieving system certificate anchors and blacklist

  information. Firefox has the capability of using this centralized store for its

  CA certificates. If the Shared System Certificates store is disabled, it can

  be enabled by running the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo update-ca-trust enable</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 82057-1}
ocil: 'To verify that the central system cerificate authority store is enabled,

  run the following command:

  <pre>$ ls -l /etc/alternatives/libnssckbi.so.x86_64</pre>

  <pre>lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 34 Apr 30 09:19 /etc/alternatives/libnssckbi.so.x86_64
