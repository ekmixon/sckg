rationale: 'When the user receives a dialog box asking if they want to save the file

  or open it with a specified application, this indicates that a plugin does

  not exist. Also, the user has not previously selected a download action or helper

  application to automatically use for that type of file. When prompted, if the user

  checks the option to ''Do this automatically for files like this from now on'',
  then

  an entry will appear for that type of file in the plugins listing, and this file

  type is automatically opened in the future. This can be a security issue. New file

  types cannot be added directly to the Application plugin listing.'
