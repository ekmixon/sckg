description: 'Limit the ciphers to strong algorithms.

  Counter (CTR) mode is also preferred over cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode.

  The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>

  demonstrates use of those ciphers:

  <pre>Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr</pre>

  <pre>chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes128-ctr</pre>

  The man page <tt>sshd_config(5)</tt> contains a list of supported ciphers.'
identifiers: {cce: 82363-3}
ocil: 'Only strong ciphers should be used. To verify that only strong

  ciphers are in use, run the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep Ciphers /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

  The output should contain only those ciphers which are considered strong, namely,

  chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes128-ctr'

rationale: 'Based on research conducted at various institutions, it was determined
  that the symmetric

  portion of the SSH Transport Protocol (as described in RFC 4253) has security weaknesses

  that allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that
  was

  encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBD) method. From that research, new Counter

  mode algorithms (as described in RFC4344) were designed that are not vulnerable
  to these

  types of attacks and these algorithms are now recommended for standard use.'
