rationale: 'These settings configure the firewall to allow connections to an FTP server.



  The first line allows initial connections to the FTP server port.

  FTP is an older protocol which is not very compatible with firewalls. During the
  initial FTP dialogue, the client

  and server negotiate an arbitrary port to be used for data transfer. The <tt>ip_conntrack_ftp</tt>  module
  is used by

  iptables to listen to that dialogue and allow connections to the data ports which
  FTP negotiates. This allows an

  FTP server to operate on a system which is running a firewall.'
