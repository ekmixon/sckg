description: 'To use Docker in production with the device mapper storage driver, the
  Docker

  daemon should be configured to use direct-lvm instead of loopback device as

  a storage. For setting up the LVM and configuring Docker, see the

rationale: 'For using Docker in production, the device mapper storage driver with
  loopback

  devices is discouraged. The suggested way of configuring device mapper storage

  driver is direct-lvm. Choosing the right storage driver and backing filesystem

  is crucial to stability and performance.'
