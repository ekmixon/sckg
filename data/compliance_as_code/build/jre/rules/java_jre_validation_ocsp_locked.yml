rationale: 'Online certificate validation provides a greater degree of validation
  of certificates

  when running a signed Java applet. Permitting execution of an applet with an invalid

  certificate may result in malware execution , system modification, invasion of privacy,

  and denial of service. As such, ensuring users cannot change settings contributes
  to

  a more consistent security profile.'
