rationale: 'Permitting execution of signed Java applets from un-trusted sources may

  result in malware running on the system, and risks system modification,

  invasion of privacy, or denial of service. As such, ensuring users cannot

  change the permission settings which control the execution of signed Java

  applets contributes to a more consistent security profile.'
