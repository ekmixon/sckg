rationale: 'The deployment.config file is used for specifying the location and execution
  of

  system-level properties for the Java Runtime Environment. By default no

  deployment.config file exists; thus, no system-wide deployment.properties file exists.

  Without the deployment.config file, setting particular options for the Java

  control panel is impossible.'
